<p>Beck Audio Forensics is a professional audio forensics service offering expert analysis of audio evidence, focusing on gunshots for legal proceedings. The client needed a website that not only reflected their credibility and professionalism but also clearly communicated their services to a target audience of attorneys, law enforcement, and private investigators. The goal was to update their existing site and transform it from a one-pager into a multi-page site with richer content that would improve their visibility in search results.</p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Design a clean, modern, and professional web presence</li>
<li>Improve information architecture for easier navigation</li>
<li>Clearly explain services offered and areas of expertise</li>
<li>Implement contact and inquiry functionality</li>
<li>Employ SEO best practices</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>
<p>We started by taking some time to better understand the unique world of forensic audio. We identified that many existing sites in this field were focusing on specific niches. Our strategy was to position Beck Audio Forensics as a highly experienced expert in the field, specifically around analyzing audio recordings of gunshots, Beck Audio's unique niche.</p>
<h3 id="our-assumptions">Our assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visitors often seek validation (credentials, past work, testimonials)</li>
<li>Content must be legally sensitive and professional</li>
<li>Visual clarity and simplicity are crucial for credibility</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-approach">Design Approach</h3>
<p>We opted for a minimalist aesthetic with a focus on typography and content clarity. The palette is bold and features high contrast for readability, reflecting the precision and neutrality expected in forensic work.</p>
<p>The homepage was updated and restructured to immediately communicate the core services, experience, and value proposition. Sectional layouts make these key ideas scannable, and make responsive design challenges easier to manage.</p>
<p>While the brand already had an established aesthetic, we refined its use in digital contexts and paired it with modern typefaces that convey professionalism and clarity.</p>
<h3 id="development-features">Development &amp; Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>We chose to keep the site hosted with Wix so that
<ol>
<li>The client could use more of their budget on content &amp; design</li>
<li>Ease of making content updates as the need arises for the client</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>We introduced a blog, "Case Notes", to enable SEO, enhance page rank, and improve lead generation</li>
<li>SEO Optimized: Structured data, proper use of meta tags, and more content</li>
<li>Security: HTTPS setup, spam protection, and secure contact forms</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved Engagement: Lower bounce rate and longer session durations</li>
<li>Increased Inquiries: more contact form submissions within the first three months</li>
<li>Positive Feedback: From both new clients and legal professionals</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is an on-going successful collaboration focused on transforming a site which was quickly thrown together into a richer experience for prospective clients. Through thoughtful design and development, Beck Audio Forensics now has a website that supports its unique niche and expands its reach within the forensic audio field.</p>
