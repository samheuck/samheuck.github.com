  <p>I was recently surprised by the realization that my dabbling, or perhaps more appropriately bumbling, with Haskell may have actually degraded my performance as a PHP developer. To be clear, I happen to think PHP is a decent language. It is the language I used for my first honest-to-goodness web application that was useful to someone. Liking PHP is unpopular - as one could easily discover with a bit of reading. But the fact is...</p>

  <p>I’m going to give you two crucial pieces of information, and I want you to answer one very simple question based on this information. The name of a file: hourly_sync.py This file is a cronjob The question is, how often does this job run? If you thought to yourself, “I don’t know yet”, you might be a developer. If you are a normal human being, you thought, “That job runs every hour”. You normal people...</p>

  <p>Part II In part 1 I discussed why I chose Jekyll to build this site and presented a high level overview of how Jekyll works. In this post, I’ll dive into the depths of Jekyll and show off some of its features. Liquid Templates The template engine used by Jekyll is called Liquid. Liquid makes it easy to create a layout and pull in page elements dynamically. Jekyll will compile content into a page using...</p>

  <p>Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby that uses the Liquid template engine. In combination with git for version control and Jenkins for deployment, Jekyll is a powerful tool not just for blogging, but also for small to medium- sized websites. Give Jekyll a try, and you can blog like a hacker. First, a minor diatribe… Web sites used to be simple. A little HTML, some text and maybe an image or two....</p>

  <p>When first learning PHP, it is quite easy to shoot yourself in the foot. PHP is forgiving and you can get away with writing some seriously crappy code. Consequently, PHP programmers often follow a similar path as they develop their skills. I started off writing horrendous code that was utterly unmaintainable. Of course I ended up rewriting all of it. Twice. And through that process, one which all programmers are familiar with, I learned some...</p>

  <p>Joel on Software by Joel Spolsky Incredibly relevant, hilarious, and snarky Joel Spolsky - you love him or you hate him, but you know he’s right. His writing may be a little unorthodox, but his anecdotes about the software industry are chock full of practical wisdom. This book is fun to read and it will make you think.

  <p>At my former job, I was involved with a group called the SWAG - The Secure Web Applications Group. One hotly debated topic was identity management and central authentication. For months the SWAG discussed plans we could implement to improve the security of our network and the various web applications that run on our network. Of course, this is a group of computer nerds. So we discuss things like how to properly salt your SHA2...</p>
