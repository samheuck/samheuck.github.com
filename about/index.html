  <p><span class="fl accent">I</span> am a <span itemprop="role">web developer</span>,
IT professional and audio engineer currently working for
<a href="http://praxent.com/about">Praxent</a> in
<span itemprop="address" itemscope="" itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address">
  <span itemprop="locality">Austin</span>,
  <span itemprop="region">TX</span>
</span>. I specialize in custom web application development using a
variety of open source technologies. I have a passion for the endless pursuit
of practical, elegant code.</p>

  <p>I was born in Montana, and grew up on a ranch in Wyoming. Being a rancher’s son
is a fate I am grateful for. The ranch taught me to work hard, to get the job
done no matter what, and to think of creative solutions to problems. Often times
when fixing a well, or repairing a fence, the tool or part we needed was miles
away - but the cows needed to drink. Knowing how to improvise in these
situations is a skill I learned well, and continue to rely on when confronted
with unexpected obstacles. Software design and information technology seem to be
breeding grounds for unexpected obstacles, and rolling with the punches is
essential. Luckily, thanks to the ranch, rolling with the punches is something I
actually enjoy.</p>

  <p>I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music Technology from Montana State University. I
have always been into computers and technology, and before I discovered the
Music Technology program, I was considering electrical engineering. However,
electrical engineering does not present many situations in which playing
saxophone would be of any benefit. So how to combine the nerd with the musician?
Music Technology!</p>

  <p>When I was going to school, I had a unique opportunity to be part of the design
and upbringing of this brand new degree program. Because the program was so new,
and the only one of its kind in the region, there were many opportunities for
volunteer work. These were not your usual undergraduate assistant, busy work
tasks - the work was essential to the success of the program. It allowed me to
be part of something bigger - something more than attending classes and getting
my degree. It also allowed me to start creating software that solved real world
headaches. I remember when I showed my newly created student information
database application to a user she exclaimed, “Wow it’s like our software,
except it doesn’t suck!” From that point on, I was hooked.</p>

  <p>Dizzy is my dog. He is a border collie, and as such, he considers it his duty
to follow me everywhere I go - including my website. He has no cattle to herd,
so he herds people, and apparently, all of my code.</p>

  <p>When Dizzy is not attempting to herd something, he is busy colluding with my
son William. My wife Kristi somehow keeps them both from destroying our house…</p>
