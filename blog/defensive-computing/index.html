    <section>
      <p>In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is no longer just an IT concern — it's a fundamental skill for everyone. Much like defensive driving helps you navigate roads safely by anticipating risks, defensive computing is a mindset that helps you navigate the digital world. This guide provides practical strategies for protecting yourself and your organization from cyber threats in 2026.</p>
<p><img src="https://samheuck.com/blog/defensive-computing/ransomware.jpg" alt="Ransomware" /></p>
<h2 id="from-hackers-to-cybercriminals-understanding-the-threat">From Hackers to Cybercriminals: Understanding the Threat</h2>
<p>The term "hacker" once conjured images of curious teenagers exploring computer systems for fun. Today we are dealing with <strong>cybercriminals</strong> — organized crime syndicates operating as sophisticated businesses.</p>
<p>Consider <strong>Evil Corp</strong>, a cybercriminal organization accused of stealing approximately <strong>$300 million</strong> over nearly a decade of organized cyber-crime. To put this in perspective, Al Capone's Chicago Outfit earned an estimated $85 million per year in 1920s dollars — equivalent to over $1 billion in today's money. Cybercrime has become nearly as lucrative as the most notorious criminal enterprises in history.</p>
<h2 id="how-cybercriminals-make-money">How Cybercriminals Make Money</h2>
<h3 id="1-ransomware">1. Ransomware</h3>
<p>Cybercriminals hold your critical technology hostage, encrypting your files and demanding payment for the decryption key. This has become one of the most profitable cybercrime models.</p>
<h3 id="2-selling-private-data">2. Selling Private Data</h3>
<p>Stolen information — particularly medical records and personal financial data — is sold on black markets. This data can be used for identity theft or fraud, or sold to other criminals.</p>
<h3 id="3-selling-destruction">3. Selling Destruction</h3>
<p>Criminals use your computer to launch attacks on others. Your compromised systems become part of a botnet, attacking other targets as a service.</p>
<h3 id="4-cons-and-scams">4. Cons and Scams</h3>
<p>The oldest trick in the book: tricking you into voluntarily sending them money through social engineering and deception.</p>
<h2 id="cultivating-a-defensive-mindset">Cultivating a Defensive Mindset</h2>
<p>Like defensive driving, defensive computing is fundamentally a mindset. Here are the core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge is power</strong>: Know what threats to watch for</li>
<li><strong>When in doubt, confirm identity</strong>: Always verify who you're dealing with</li>
<li><strong>Pause and think before you click</strong>: A moment of reflection can prevent disaster</li>
<li><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work</strong>: Share information about threats with colleagues and family</li>
<li><strong>Seek to be UN-confused</strong>: If something doesn't make sense, stop and investigate</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, cyber threats are constant—like the weather. Tools like <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fortiguard.fortinet.com/threat-map">Fortinet's Threat Map</a> show real-time cyber attacks happening globally. Awareness of this ongoing threat landscape is the first step in protection.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-common-threat-vectors">Understanding Common Threat Vectors</h2>
<p>The FBI <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210521.pdf">reports</a> that Conti, an active cyber-criminal gang, gains access to victim networks through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Malicious email links</li>
<li>Malicious attachments</li>
<li>Stolen passwords</li>
<li>Microsoft Office documents with embedded computer code</li>
</ul>
<p>These attack vectors haven't changed dramatically because they continue to work. Let's explore how to defend against each.</p>
<h2 id="password-security-your-first-line-of-defense">Password Security: Your First Line of Defense</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-password">What Makes a Good Password?</h3>
<p>Strong passwords are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long (at least 16 characters)</li>
<li>Unique to each account, not re-used</li>
<li>Complex (mixing letters, numbers, and symbols)</li>
<li>Unpredictable (not based on personal information)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="password-managers">Password Managers</h3>
<p>Remembering dozens of strong, unique passwords is impossible. Password managers solve this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating strong, random passwords</li>
<li>Storing them securely with encryption</li>
<li>Auto-filling login forms</li>
<li>Syncing across devices</li>
</ul>
<p>Using 1Password (or another password manager) is one of the best security investments you can make.</p>
<h3 id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
<p>MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond your password. Even if criminals steal your password, they can't access your account without the second factor. Always enable MFA when available.</p>
<h3 id="passkeys">Passkeys</h3>
<p>Passkeys are a new type of authentication key, adding protection by requiring you to authenticate using a trusted device or password manager before you can log in to a website. Passkeys are not yet universal, and every service implements them a little differently. For now, strong password + 2-factor is still the most common and reliable method.</p>
<h2 id="email-security-the-primary-attack-vector">Email Security: The Primary Attack Vector</h2>
<p>Email remains the most common way cybercriminals gain initial access to systems.</p>
<h3 id="recognizing-scams-and-cons">Recognizing Scams and Cons</h3>
<p>Scams typically leverage two psychological triggers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Urgency</strong>: "Act now or lose access to your account!"</li>
<li><strong>Authority</strong>: Messages appearing to come from executives, IT departments, or government agencies</li>
</ol>
<p>When you encounter urgency and authority together, be especially suspicious.</p>
<h3 id="the-danger-of-links-and-attachments">The Danger of Links and Attachments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clicking on a malicious link is enough to compromise your computer</strong>. Links can exploit browser vulnerabilities or direct you to phishing sites.</li>
<li><strong>Opening an attachment can install and run malicious code</strong> without any additional action on your part.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="email-security-best-practices">Email Security Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never share passwords or codes via email or text message</strong></li>
<li>If you get an request you aren't expecting, verify it is legitimate by reaching out to the sender</li>
<li>Hover over links to preview the actual URL before clicking</li>
<li>Be wary of unexpected attachments, even from known senders</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ransomware-preparation-is-everything">Ransomware: Preparation is Everything</h2>
<p>Your level of preparation determines the impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unprepared</strong>: Ransomware is extremely damaging, potentially crippling your business or destroying irreplaceable files</li>
<li><strong>Prepared</strong>: Ransomware becomes a minor inconvenience. With a reliable backup system you can ignore the ransom threat, restore from backups, and all you lose is a few hours of time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robust-backup-systems">Robust Backup Systems</h3>
<p>For backup strategy, follow the <strong>3-2-1 Backup Rule</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3</strong> copies of your data</li>
<li>On <strong>2</strong> different devices</li>
<li>With <strong>1</strong> copy stored off-site</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if ransomware encrypts your primary system and local backups, you can restore from an off-site backup.</p>
<p>Make sure to test your backup strategy, to make sure you can restore quickly if needed.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-case-studies">Real-World Case Studies</h2>
<h3 id="case-study-twitter-2020-phishing-and-social-engineering">Case Study: Twitter 2020 - Phishing and Social Engineering</h3>
<p>In July 2020, a combination of phishing and social engineering led to one of Twitter's most significant breaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attackers created a fake website resembling an internal company website</li>
<li>Posing as help desk staff, threat actors called Twitter employees</li>
<li>They directed employees to submit their credentials to the fake website</li>
<li>Using these credentials, attackers seized control of high-profile accounts (Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Apple Inc.)</li>
<li>They posted cryptocurrency scams, collecting over $100,000.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Defense</strong>: You can prevent this attack by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring multi-factor authentication</li>
<li>Instructing employees to hang up on unexpected calls and call back to the real help desk</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="case-study-colonial-pipeline-the-cost-of-weak-passwords">Case Study: Colonial Pipeline - The Cost of Weak Passwords</h3>
<p>In May 2021, a weak password led to one of America's most significant infrastructure attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cybercriminals purchased an employee's personal password from the black market</li>
<li>The same password granted access to computers controlling critical infrastructure</li>
<li>Ransomware was installed, locking the company out of their own systems</li>
<li>Colonial Pipeline paid <strong>$4.4 million</strong> to unlock their systems</li>
<li>The attack caused fuel shortages across the southeastern United States</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Defense</strong>: You can prevent this attack with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long passwords unique to each account</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication</li>
<li>Reliable backup systems</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="case-study-2025-nodejs-supply-chain-attack-the-ripple-effect">Case Study: 2025 NodeJS Supply Chain Attack - The Ripple Effect</h3>
<p>In early 2025, a phishing email led to a supply chain attack affecting millions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A software developer maintaining dozens of popular code libraries responded to a phishing email</li>
<li>The threat actor used the compromised account to inject malicious code into libraries downloaded <strong>2 billion times per week</strong></li>
<li>This malicious code stole passwords and cryptocurrency from software developers worldwide</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Defense</strong>: You can prevent this attack by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping software updated</li>
<li>Checking email headers before you click or download anything</li>
<li>If an email directs you to log in to a website, log in by typing the website into a browser</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cybercriminals operate as businesses because crime pays, but by adopting a defensive mindset and following security best practices, you can dramatically reduce your risk.</p>
<p>Remember that cybersecurity is like the weather — constantly present and ever-changing. With knowledge and preparation, you can prevent most attacks and minimize the impact of any that do occur.</p>
