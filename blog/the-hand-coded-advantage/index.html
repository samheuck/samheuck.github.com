<p><img src="https://samheuck.com/blog/the-hand-coded-advantage/hand-coded-advantage.webp" alt="The Hand-coded advantage" /></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here is no doubt that presence on the internet is essential for businesses large and small. A website is a business card (and so much more) that can be seen by everyone, everywhere, instantly, without having to pay to have it printed each time someone happens to see it.</p>
<p>Sorry to be a <em>Captain Obvious</em> here, but the digital world is overwhelming and complex. In my experience, most entrepreneurs are pretty smart cookies. No pun intended regarding cookies. (Digital cookies are kind of... necessary evils). But even they struggle at times with the truly mind-boggling array of choices that need to be made to do something as seemingly simple as set up a website for their new business.</p>
<p>I imagine they often think to themselves something along the lines of "I don't have the time or the desire to learn how to do all of this the right way. Maybe there's a shortcut?" and they find themselves turning to tools like Wix, WordPress and WPEngine, SquareSpace, Shopfiy and the like. These services are great at providing easy to use tools for those who need a website, and they have their place. Many of our clients rely on WordPress or Wix for their businesses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, however, these tools tend to take up more time in the long run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like all technology, and any tool really, the choice to use these tools comes with tradeoffs. On one hand, they provide comforting drag-and-drop editors that let you edit your content yourself without having to even think about the code underneath. In my experience, however, these tools tend to take up more time in the long run. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Websites grow. Websites change over time. What you wanted "yesterday" slowly morphs into something different "tomorrow". What starts as one page with a few images and some text will inevitably grow into a more complex web of multiple pages, maybe some small widgets that you want to reuse in multiple pages, and the desire for a different experience for a visitor using their phone than someone on their laptop. All of these things on their own are commonplace for websites. But soon you'll find yourself repeating the same "drag this image to the center" task on dozens of pages. Or "copy all of this to a temporary page so I can paste it and edit on the new page". These design tasks take a little bit of time for you to do. But you will end up doing them constantly. All of those little time drag &amp; drops will add up, and suddenly, it's nearly 5 o'clock and all you got done was putting some images on a some pages.</p>
<p>Imagine if, instead of dragging &amp; dropping, you could describe what you want all of your blog posts to look like? Then, instead of clicking and dragging all day, you can go have some meetings with potential customers. And by the time you meet again, Sam Heuck Web Development will have a hand-coded blog set up for you that places all that text, all those widgets, and all those images in the pixel perfect spot on <strong>every single page</strong> without you having to lift a finger?</p>
<div class="note">
<h2 id="the-hand-coded-advantage">The Hand-coded advantage:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong class="accent">Page speed</strong></p>
<p>Pages loading slowly? There's nothing faster than a page designed and hand-built by an expert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="accent">Precision</strong></p>
<p>Images and text in weird places on some pages but not others? Hand-built websites offer pixel perfection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="accent">Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Have dozens of pages that need new images? A hand-coded site allows them to be replaced quickly without affecting your layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="accent">Focus</strong></p>
<p>Would you rather be dragging around that product image endlessly? Or would you rather be chatting up your next customer? Or improving your product? Let the experts at SHWD help you control your business focus and your time the way you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="accent">Ownership</strong></p>
<p>When you make a hand-coded website, it is uniquely yours. It represents your brand, your way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The underrated advantage of hand-coded websites and apps is that nothing beats the precision, speed, and efficient consistency of code. This is what <strong>Sam <span class="accent">Heuck</span> Web <span class="accent">Development</span></strong> is offering you. Go meet with your next client, and after, sip a margarita while we do the hard work for you. <a class="contact-me">Reach out today.</a></p>
