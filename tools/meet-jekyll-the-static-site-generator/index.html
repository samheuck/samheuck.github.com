<p>Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby that uses the Liquid template
engine. In combination with git for version control and Jenkins for deployment,
Jekyll is a powerful tool not just for blogging, but also for small to medium-
sized websites. Give Jekyll a try, and you can blog like a hacker.</p>

<h3 id="first-a-minor-diatribe">First, a minor diatribe…</h3>

<p>Web sites used to be simple. A little HTML, some text and maybe an image or two.
When you wanted to add content to a site, you would simply upload some html
to the server with an FTP client, and your new content would be live. Someone would
request to view that page, and the server would serve the HTML requested. No
databases had to be queried, no code had to be interpreted by the server, and
because of the simplicity, the site was fast and secure. Sometimes, when I am
neck deep in a Drupal site trying to wrangle it into submission, I think to
myself “Wow, whatever happened to just uploading an HTML file…”.</p>

<h3 id="enter-the-static-site-generator">Enter the static site generator…</h3>

<p>So what if, instead of using an application stack powered by PHP and MySQL to
create web pages on the fly, a website were compiled, in effect <em>frozen</em> into a
static state, and then served to the client browser. Just like the good old days!
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is an open source project written in Ruby by
github co-founder Tom Preston-Werner. Designed for blogs, and flexible enough
that it could be used to create just about anything, Jekyll is a tool that does
exactly that. It gathers up content, styling and javascript, organizes it into
a predefined directory structure, and writes the necessary HTML.</p>

<h3 id="advantages-of-static-websites">Advantages of static websites</h3>

<div class="center-list">

  <p><span class="icon-kub-approve green"></span> <strong>Speed</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Web servers were originally designed to do one thing, serve a document.
With Jekyll, that is exactly what your web server is doing. It doesn’t
have to provision an instance of the PHP interpreter to execute expensive
code. No database queries have to be made. Content is simply… delivered.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="icon-kub-approve green"></span> <strong>Security</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Because there is no backend application, there can be no database
injection attacks, session highjacking, or malicious cross-site scripting.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="icon-kub-approve green"></span> <strong>Version Control</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Jekyll is designed to pair with source code control systems like Git. This
means your posts are automatically versioned and can easily be backed up
on github or bitbucket.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="icon-kub-approve green"></span> <strong>Easy deployment</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>How do you deploy a static site? Copy the files to the server. Done.
With source control, this is a trivial push and subsequent pull. You
could also use rsync, or even plain old FTP to send files to the server.
The 1337 among us might like to use Jenkins and a post commit hook
to automatically build and publish the site, but that requires some
extra setup server side. No matter how you deploy, though, static sites
make it painless.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="icon-kub-approve green"></span> <strong>Free Hosting!</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>For simple sites, you can use github pages or Dropbox to store and host
your website. This isn’t right for everyone, but free hosting is a nice
perk. Github pages is a great option for coders. You just have to create
a repository using your account name and anything in the master branch
will be published using jekyll.</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

<h3 id="disadvantages-of-static-site-generators">Disadvantages of static site generators</h3>

<div class="center-list">
  <p><span class="icon-kub-remove red"></span> <strong>Persistence</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>There is no database. Anything that requires persistence, such as comments,
will need to be outsourced to a service. Disqus is popular for comments.
Also database access of any kind has to be managed from the front end. This
isn’t a huge problem with javascript frameworks like Ember and Backbone,
but if you are used to server-side coding, there is a learning curve.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="icon-kub-remove red"></span> <strong>This is <em>not</em> Wordpress…</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>There is a reason this is called <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">blogging like a hacker</a>.
You need a solid HTML &amp; CSS background, and some knowledge of how to install, maintain, and
configure Ruby gems. You need to know how template engines work. And you also have
to be willing to spend some time sifting through issue cues and bug reports when
you run into an problem. If “user friendly” and one button install is what you’re
looking for, Jekyll is not for you.</p>

<h3 id="the-basics">The basics</h3>

<p>When jekyll runs, it will copy all files and folders in the project root into
its build directory <em>except</em> for directories and files with a preceding
underscore. You can also specify files to ignore in _config.yml. A typical site
might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>_layouts/
_includes/
_posts/
_plugins/
_site/
_config.yml
index.md
images/
about/
blog/
</code></pre>

<p>When the <code>~$ jekyll</code> command is issued, the site is generated inside the
_site directory. _layouts contains the main template files, and _includes can
be used for content partials which can be placed into pages with Liquid. Any
file that begins with:</p>

<pre><code>---
layout: default
title: a page
foo: bar
---
</code></pre>

<p>… will be parsed by Jekyll. This special header is the
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter">YAML Front Matter</a>
block. There are some reserved variables like layout, and publish, but you
can also add any variable you need. For example, you could have a variable
called sidebar that could be used to include a specific piece of sidebar
content on a specific page.</p>

<p>Jekyll relies on the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a> template
engine to compile content. The syntax is intuitive and I found the learning
curve for Liquid to be smooth and easy. Jekyll will parse Liquid include
statements and search for the included content inside the _includes directory
automatically. You don’t have to worry about registering paths to things.</p>

<p>One of my favorite features of Jekyll is that it has built-in support
for <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.
You can write posts in plain text, and Jekyll will convert the Markdown
into HTML. For example, paragraphs of text will be properly wrapped in &lt;p&gt;
tags, and any text surrounded by asterisks will be bold. Jekyll has
support for several Markdown engines; I like to use
<a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/">Kramdown</a>.</p>

<p>This constitutes the basic stack for Jekyll. Write content in Markdown, create
layouts for different types of content, and separate out partial blocks with
Liquid includes. Then run <code>~$ jekyll</code> from the project root, and upload the
contents of _site to your webserver.</p>

<p>I built this site in Drupal, and then discovered Jekyll. I promptly redesigned
my site using Jekyll and <em>I haven’t looked back</em>. In that process I discovered
some essential add-ons and helpers for Jekyll. The next post will be a tutorial
on some of what I learned.</p>

<div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Jekyll plugins</li>
    <li>Automatic <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> compilation with Jekyll</li>
    <li>Automatic compression of CSS and javascript using <a href="http://yui.github.com/yuicompressor/">yui-compressor</a></li>
    <li>Workflow helper tasks with <a href="https://github.com/wycats/thor">Thor</a>, a Rake alternative</li>
    <li>Sitemap generation on build</li>
    <li>Deployment with <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>So stay tuned, and happy coding!</p>
