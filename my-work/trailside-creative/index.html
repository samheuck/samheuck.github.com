<h2 id="overview">Overview:</h2>
<p>Trailside Creative is an industrial design studio based in Texas. The firm specializes in outdoor gear and action sports products. Their website, https://trailsidecreative.com, highlights their commitment to beautiful yet functional, human-centered design, and a passion for active lifestyles.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process:</h2>
<p>Trailside Creative aimed to create a digital platform that reflects their expertise in product design and development. The website needed to showcase their services, highlight past projects, and communicate their mission to inspire active, healthy lifestyles through design.</p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improve the user experience for site visitors.</li>
<li>Address page load times and performance issues.</li>
<li>Optimize the experience of handling incoming leads for the business development team.</li>
<li>Showcase expertise: Present a visually striking portfolio that demonstrates their capabilities in industrial design, prototyping, and manufacturing support.</li>
<li>User-friendly navigation: Ensure visitors can easily access information about services, past work, and contact details.</li>
<li>Reflect brand identity: design a site that embodies Trailside Creative's innovative and outdoor-focused ethos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-approach">Design approach:</h3>
<p>The website employs a clean, modern aesthetic with high-quality imagery and a cohesive color palette that aligns with the brand's identity. Typography and layout choices enhance readability and visual appeal.</p>
<p>Content is organized to guide visitors through the company's offerings, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services: Detailed descriptions of capabilities such as research &amp; strategy, 3D printing &amp; prototyping, and sourcing &amp; manufacturing support.</li>
<li>Portfolio: Showcases of past projects that highlight the studio's design process and outcomes.</li>
<li>About: Information about the team's mission and approach to design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development">Development:</h3>
<p>The site was originally built with WordPress and we didn't want to &quot;fix&quot; what isn't broken. WordPress provides an excellent
set of tools that enables busy business owners to stay on top of their marketing goals. We decided to stick with WordPress in order to take advantage of the familiarity and comfort level the team already had with their site and tools.</p>
<p>The site is responsive, ensuring readability across a variety of screen sizes. Much of the content needed to be tailored to make it readable on smaller screens.</p>
<p>We also made some critical updates to the contact form integration that enabled the client to be more effective at processing
incoming leads from the web.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>The updated website loads faster, has better SEO, all while effectively communicating Trailside Creative's expertise and values. It serves as a great resource for potential clients to understand the studio's services and view examples of their work. The user-friendly design and clear content structure enhance the user experience and encourage inquiries.</p>
<p>Trailside Creative's website stands as a testament to their dedication to quality design and innovation. It successfully conveys their physical product design expertise via a compelling digital presence, and it supports their mission to inspire active, healthy lifestyles through thoughtful design.</p>
