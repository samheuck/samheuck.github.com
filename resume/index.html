  <h4 id="projects-1">Projects</h4>

  <p><em>Interactive Health Technologies</em></p>

  <p>I led a team charged with maintaining and improving a suite of software purpose-built
  to track health and fitness goals in schools throughout the country. The software is built
  with a combination of Drupal, EmberJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and .NET, and it serves thousands of teachers
  and students from California to Florida.</p>

  <p><em>Texas Youth Football Association</em></p>

  <p>I helped build a web application that enables TYFA to certify young athletes to participate in TYFA’s
  football and cheer sports leagues. Built in EmberJS and backed by a REST API written in Silex, the TYFA app
  allows hundreds of organizations across Texas to register over 15,000 athletes and 3,000 volunteers each
  season.</p>

  <p><em>Simple Numbers</em></p>

  <p>I led a team of three, and we built a web application that helps businesses summarize
  their financials for an at-a-glance view of financial health. Users upload QuickBooks data files
  and then categorize accounts into predefined “buckets”. The application can then analyze these
  buckets and report back to the user. It was built with Symfony2, BackboneJS, and MongoDB.</p>

  <p><em>World Market Explorer</em></p>

  <p>I was responsible for operations, maintenance, and feature development of the World Market
  loyalty rewards website. The site serves 5 million users and was built with Django. It runs
  on a load-balanced cluster of Apache web servers, memcache and Postgres.</p>
